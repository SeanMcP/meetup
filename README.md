# Jr Devs Meetup

## Goal
The goal of the Jr Devs meetup is to provide attendees an opportunity to learn something new, share projects or ideas, and connect with other developers. The overall emphasis is to build a community of learners who can support and encourage each other in their journey as developers.

## Rules
Jr Devs has the following rules to help make us realize our goal.
1) Be friendly
    - Introduce yourself everytime you speak to someone (because we’re all bad at remembering names)
2) Be open
    - Share the things you’re working on and be honest about the struggle -- we’ve all been there
3) Be helpful
    - Come looking for ways you can help other people with their code, projects, network, or whatever
