# Share

Sharing is an integral part of a meetup. Jr Devs have the opportunity to share their work and progress in a small peer group.

## Elements of sharing
1) **What are you working on?**

    This can be a application, website, project, business idea, or really anything.
    
2) **What have you learned in the process?**
3) **What is something or one area that is giving you trouble?**

## Listening

Those who are not sharing have the responsibility to listen to whomever is speaking.
