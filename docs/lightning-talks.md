# Lightning Talk

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk), a **lightning talk** is "a very short presentation lasting only a few minutes, given at a conference or similar forum." Jr Devs meetups feature one or two ten-minute lightning talks at the beginning of every meeting.

The goal of a ligntning talk is to:
1. Introduce Jr Devs to a new topic, concept, or implementation
2. Give them an opportunity to try it for themselves

As a result, there are a few elements that should be included: **introduction**, **demo**, and **practice**.

## Elements

### Introduction
Since Jr Devs are coming to a every meeting at different levels, it is crucial to provide a simple description of the topic you are introducing. There are two parts:

1. What the technology is
2. How the technology is used

For example, let's say you are giving a presentation on a cool CSS property. In order to begin your lightning talk on CSS, you could start with:

> CSS stands for cascading stylesheets and has been an important part of the web for the last two decades. CSS is used to add color and position every webpage you visit.
