# Lightning Talks

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk), a **lightning talk** is "a very short presentation lasting only a few minutes, given at a conference or similar forum." Jr Devs meetups feature one 10-15 minute lightning talk at the beginning of every meeting.

The goal of a ligntning talk is to:
1. Introduce Jr Devs to a new topic, concept, or implementation
2. Give them an opportunity to try it for themselves

As a result, there are a few elements that should be included: **introduction**, **demo**, and **practice**.

## Elements

### Introduction
Since Jr Devs are coming to a every meeting at different levels, it is crucial to provide a simple description of the topic you are introducing. There are two parts:

1. What the technology is
2. How the technology is used

For example, let's say you are giving a presentation on a cool CSS property. In order to begin your lightning talk on CSS, you could start with:

> CSS stands for cascading stylesheets and has been an important part of the web for the last two decades. CSS is used to add color and position every webpage you visit.

### Demo
Regardless of the topic, your goal should be to demonstrate the new technology for other Jr Devs. Provide a working example that demonstrates the technology in action. This could be a live or local site, an online development environment, or even a command line (with font size increased!).

Online playgrounds are perfect ways to demonstrate a new technology. Checkout the following for some helpful examples:
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io): HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/): HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/): React, Angular, Vue
- [Code Playground](https://code.sololearn.com/#py): Python, Java, C++, C, C#, Ruby, PHP
- [Repl.it](https://repl.it/)
- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/): Markdown

### Practice
Hands-on practice is the best way to learn a new concept or topic. If possible, try to provide an opportunity for Jr Devs to practice the technology from your talk.

Send them to one of the playgrounds above and give them a task to complete. Or provide a working example and have them make an adjustment or refactor a solution. The better and more meaningful an interaction with a new idea, the better the student's learning will be.
